# industry-classification
This repository implements a hierarchical classification system using a series of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The model handles multi-level categories by breaking down complex problems into a sequence of simpler decisions, leveraging a tree-like data structure for improved accuracy and more interpretable results.
